Ralf was arrested for hacking into a large American 
company. They got into the CEO's
personal files and left a very rude
message. Well, he's grown up a bit and
has been putting his knowledge to
very good use. He's now a computer
security expert, a 'white hat" hacker
who uses his skills to make cyberspace
safer. Ralph, what exactly is hacking
and how do you go about hacking into
a system?
Ralph Hacking simply means getting into
computer systems…you don't have
permission to get into. Erm, there are
various ways of doing it. You can get in
by trying to guess somebody's
password. Or you find a bug in a
computer system that will allow people
with certain passwords to get in where
they shouldn't.
So you're sitting in front of your
computer…somewhere, how do you set
about getting into someone else's
system?
R Sometimes it's very simple. People
who hack into systems for a living -
because they're employed by
companies to test their systems -
would say the first thing you do is to
phone up someone who uses the
system and you say, "Hello, I'm from
your company, We want to test a new
system…We need your password,
please, so that we can include you in
the trial." People are too trusting. They
normally hand it over.
That's
the
easy way. If
that
doesn't
work, then you find out by trying to
connect to it over the Internet. And
normally that's not desperately
difficult.
Once you connect to the computer it
will…ask you to…log on and type an ID
and password. You might at the
simplest level try typing in 'guest" or
"demo' or 'help' and see what it gives
you.
I How can you avoid being hacked into?
R
There's a lot you can do but you have
to keep at it to keep ahead of the
hackers. Erm, you can install firewalls
to restrict access to a network. You can
have a callback system to make sure
remote clients are who they say they
are. Having really secure passwords
helps. Don't use a common name or a
dictionary word or anything short.
Check the system regularly using event
logs to find failed access attempts.
